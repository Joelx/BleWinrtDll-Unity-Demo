# BleWinrtDll-Unity-Demo


This is a small Unity demo project showing a possible implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/adabru/BleWinrtDll">BleWinrtDLL repository</a> by <a href="https://github.com/adabru">adabru</a>.
<br>
Included is a small Unity scene containing a GUI that lists scanned BLE devices and makes the connection to a BLE device accessible via button click. 
<br>
All you need to do first is to fill in the corresponding fields `targetDeviceName`, `serviceUuid` and `characteristicUuids` in the `BleTest.cs` file.
